// few deliberate edge cases mixed in alongside the original 3 invalid rows:
//  - row[4] — Lead Time unit isn't one of our options ("Fortnights"), so the
//             unit dropdown renders in its unset/error state with
//             "“Fortnights” couldn’t be applied due to its format."
//  - row[5] — Selling Price came in a foreign currency ($) — the numeric
//             value is kept as-is and flagged for the user to verify.
//  - row[6] — Name came in longer than the 100-char cap — already truncated
//             to 100 chars here (mirroring what normalizeMappedRows would do
//             for a real import) and flagged via __truncatedFields so the
//             Review step shows "Max. 100 characters. Extra text removed." Given
//             an "Aa " prefix so it still sorts into the first 10 rows under
//             the Review step's default ascending Name sort.
// All three are on page 1 (first 10 rows) so they're easy to spot without paging.
