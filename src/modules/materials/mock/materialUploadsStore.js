// ── Dummy data generator for the Review-status seed ─────────────────────────
// Expands a Review-status draft to enough rows for the Review step to demo
// pagination/search/filtering, with a couple of deliberate edge cases mixed
// in so validation is visible without needing to page through everything:
//  - row[1] — missing Name/SKU (blank required field).
//  - row[2] — missing Category (blank required field).
//  - row[3] — ABC Classification isn't one of A/B/C ("D"), so the dropdown
//             renders in its unset/error state with
//             "“D” couldn’t be applied due to its format."
//  - row[4] — Material Type came in as a value with no matching alias
//             ("Composite" — unlike e.g. "Semi Finished", which normalizeMaterialTypeValue
//             *would* map to "SemiFinished"), showing
//             "“Composite” couldn’t be applied due to its format."
//  - row[5] — Name came in longer than the 100-char cap — already truncated
//             to 100 chars here (mirroring what normalizeMappedRows would do
//             for a real import) and flagged via __truncatedFields so the
//             Review step shows "Max. 100 characters. Extra text removed." Given
//             an "Aa " prefix so it still sorts into the first 10 rows under
//             the Review step's default ascending Name sort.
