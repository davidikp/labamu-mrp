/**
 * @module section-builder/sections/shared/productSource
 * @description Storefront product source — lets a storefront feature (RFQ's
 * product picker today; any future product-aware section tomorrow) ask "what
 * products belong to the current template?" without knowing whether the
 * answer is a template's own real product data, the generic cross-template
 * demo catalog, or (eventually) a live API. Mirrors the exact pattern
 * heroRecipes.js/formRecipes.js/navRecipes.js already use for internal,
 * non-merchant-facing per-template resolution: `theme.productCatalog` (set
 * only by templates with their own storefront product data, e.g. Houzez —
 * see mocks/houzezProducts.js) falling back to the generic demo catalog
 * (mocks/catalog.json, today's Xinear/clothing-domain products) — never a
 * theme-name conditional.
 *
 * Deliberately a plain resolver function, not a service/hook/context: every
 * consumer today (RFQ) already receives `theme` as a prop, so there's
 * nothing here that needs its own data-fetching lifecycle — see
 * quote_request_form/Renderer.jsx's call sites.
 *
 * Phase 1 (Shop/PDP foundation) extends the normalized shape with
 * handle/images/compareAtPrice/stock/category/description/priceValue, all
 * additive — `id`/`name`/`image`/`price` keep their exact pre-existing
 * values and meaning, so RFQ (the only consumer today) is unaffected.
