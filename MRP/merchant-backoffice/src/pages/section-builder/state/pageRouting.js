/**
 * @module section-builder/state/pageRouting
 * @description Generic, parameterized storefront-page matching — resolves a
 * pathname against a store's `pages` list the same way a real router would,
 * so a parameterized system page's slug (e.g. `/products/:handle`) matches
 * `/products/dewalt-level-kit` and extracts `{ handle: 'dewalt-level-kit' }`,
 * not just an exact-string page (`/`, `/about`). Deliberately decoupled from
 * whether the extracted param actually resolves to a real product/collection
 * — that's a future phase's concern (see productSource.js); this module only
 * answers "does a page route exist for this path".
 *
 * Uses react-router-dom's own `matchPath` (already a project dependency, v7)
 * rather than a hand-rolled parser, so page slugs stay ordinary route
 * patterns merchants/templates already author them as.
 */

/**
 * Resolves `pathname` against `pages` (in list order — first match wins).
 * Returns `{ page, params }` on a match, `null` otherwise. An exact page
 * (`/`, `/about`) is just a `matchPath` with no `:params`, so this also
 * replaces plain exact-slug lookups — no separate code path needed.
